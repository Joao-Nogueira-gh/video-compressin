## \class BitStream
# Adaptation of already existing code to: support a single mode of file manipulation at a time,
# write one bit to a file, read one bit from a file, write N bits to a file, read N bits from a
# file, write value M using N bits to a file, read N bits from a file and the value these
# correspond to.<br>
# Every function aborts the program if it requires a different mode. For instance, if the function
# _writebit() is called with Bitstream on READ mode.
